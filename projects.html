            This website was coded from scratch using html, CSS and JavaScript. I thought building a website would be a good
            opportunity to enhance my profile as an applicant while also learning some new technical skills. 
            It was my first real experience
            with web development and front end development in general. I enjoy the creative aspects of web 
            development and hope to continue to develop and add interesting features to my site.

        <p>
            Below I've included snippets of my work from the math research I program I participated in last summer.
             The colorful graphs were generated 
            by the Python program we developed to model the commmuting graphs of finite matrix groups and rings.
            After studying these groups and rings and their associated commuting graphs, we created and proved a final Theorem
            which was broken up into four distinct propositions, the first of which I've included below.

            Linked below is a Medium post published by myself and two of my peers on stroke prediction 
            using various binary classifiers. Given that we were working under 
            time, computational and data quality constraints, the expectation was not a perfectly accurate classifier. 
            Rather, it was an opportunity to demonstrate understanding of the process of building and evaluating different
            machine learning models - preprocessing data, tuning hyperparameters, understanding and evaluating different 
            performance metrics, and identifying model shortcomings and ethical implications.

        <h2>
            Gin Rummy Project
        </h2>
        <p>
            For a CS final project in 2022, I built a 2-player, interactive game of the card game Gin Rummy in C++. 
            The project was open ended and only required that we implement and link several different classes using C++. I 
            love games of all kind, so I thought it would be a fun challenge to emulate one of my favorite card games using code!
            The game is composed of four different classes:
            a class to represent a collection of cards for the deck and player hands, the 'board'
            (cards that have been discarded and are available to be picked up by a player), a class to represent the 'table'(cards that have been 
            put down for points by either player) and finally a class for the game itself to execute the game and 
            track player scores. The most challenging part of this project was catching all the edge
            cases and making sure a player was blocked from playing an illegal move. I was very happy with how the game turned 
            out given the time constraints of the project and was selected to present my project to the lecture at the end of the 
            semester.
