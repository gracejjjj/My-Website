        <p>Welcome to my Website! My name is Grace and I am 21 years old and currently a senior in college. I'm from 
            Natick, Massachusetts where I was raised with my three brothers. I grew up playing soccer and basketball and love 
            competition of all kinds - athletic matches, board games, card games, contests. I love strategy oriented
            situations that challenge me to optimize efficiency and performance. 
            
            
            
            I am now majoring in Mathematics and
            Computer Science and minoring in Economics at Hamilton College. I love studying these subjects, as they all 
            require strategic thinking and efficient problem solving, and intersect with one another in super 
            interesting ways. I am currently most interested in the powerful Machine Learning models being used to 
            model and analyze large problems. Behind these models is complex mathematical theory and lots and lots of code. 
            I would like to be part of better understanding and explaining the inner workings of these powerful tools
            and how to most efficiently and ethically use them. More broadly, I hope to be challenged in my career with 
            complex quantitative problems whose solutions are impactful.

            I attend to Hamilton College and am Majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science and minoring in Economics.
            Hamilton is a small liberal arts college in Upstate New York that I have grown to love
            over the past three years. Because the student body is so small, cubs and leadership opportunities are 
            very accessible and it's easy to get involved. I have had a great college experience and will be very 
            sad to say goodbye next Spring.

            My family! I have a twin brother and two older brothers - never a dull moment in our household!

        <p>
            I love soccer! I have played my whole life and am now I am the president of 
            the women's club team at Hamilton. This means I handle all administrative tasks
            and am the point of contact for league administrators, Hamilton administrators and students. I 
            schedule games, book and run practices, hold E-Board elections, create game rosters, 
            and advertise the club to new students. Our team is completely student led and 
            I'm very proud of the environment we've cultivated over the past 3 years.

            If you look closely in the team picture above, you will see that one of the players is not 
            like the rest (front middle)! I am a huge dog lover, and my dog Georgia (club soccer mascot), is one of my
            proudest accomplishments. Georgia was the result of a 30 slide powerpoint presentation I created with 
            a top to bottom argument on why our family needed a dog - research on hypoallergenic breeds, 
            interviews with hypoallergenic dog owners, air purification technology that would alleviate 
            allergy symptoms, statistics on dog ownership and happiness - you name it, it was
            in that slideshow. The second dog in the picture to the left, Eddie, was a later addition
            who belongs to my twin brother at college.

        <p>
            I have loved cooking since middle school, and recently have gotten into baking sourdough!
            Cooking is therapeutic in that it allows me to experiment and be creative in a very low stakes 
            situation. I find it very satisfying and rewarding to be able to create with my own hands and 
            share and enjoy my creations with friends and family!
