        <p>
            This past summer, I was a full time intern on the Data Architecture
            and Development team at Draper Labs in Cambridge, MA. The Data Arch & 
            Dev team is responsible for designing, building and maintaining Draper's proprietary 
            databases. I was working primarily on software development in Kotlin, a relatively
            new Java derivative. I contributed to a project to refactor the existing data 
            dictionary for the largest of the proprietary databases, containing over 30,000 parameters.
            I learned a ton about the software development process - version control, testing code robustly,
            code pipelines, CI/CD, building and using utilities and libraries. I worked on twelve different 
            merge requests that were all successfully merged and will be deployed in the next software 
            release. My biggest takeaway from the internship is how important organization, communication and
            foresight is in the software development process - a software artifact must be well defined 
            and well understood by everyone involved in the development process. I saw several examples of 
            shortcuts and quick fixes in the past leading to technical debt that my team now has to handle.

        <p>
            For Summer 2023, I participated in a Math Research Program with the New York City Math Alliance. 
            I worked with a group of two other students to study various open questions about the commuting 
            graphs of various matrix groups and rings. The research culminated in a paper proving a theorem 
            we created about the diameter of commuting graphs over the group of matrices over Z mod n. The program 
            was an opportunity to experience completely self-directed work with no concrete solution or desired outcome, 
            and was a great opportunity to study the material covered in many of my college courses on a much deeper,
             theoretical level. Most of our work dealt with Abstract and Linear Algebra, and also involved 
             programming in C++ and Python in order to model the commuting graphs that we were studying. It was very
             cool to be able to use my computer science background to automate these visuals in my math research! See
             the projects tab for a few examples of these diagrams and a high level description of our theorem.

            This past Spring, I had the opportunity to spend a semester abroad in Stockholm, Sweden and
            was accepted to a program with a focus in Machine Learning. Over the course of the program, we 
            learned about the mathematical theory behind common machine learning models, as well as how to build them 
            using Python libraries and various datasets. As a math and computer science double major, I found
            this material super interesting as it lies at the direct intersection of my two major interests. 
            The program had weekly field studies 
            where we visited companies and research institutions who were using machine learning
            to create cutting edge technologies in various industries including medicine, sports performance, 
            law and others. Our professor was earning her PhD in Machine Learning and AI Ethics,
            so we spent a portion of the semester studying the ethics of 
            various AI tools and how to combat biases that are often embedded in these powerful models. 
            The semester culminated in a final project that included building predictive models using a dataset
            of our choice and evaluating their performance and ethical implications. It was an 
            incredible experience and definitely left me wanting to learn more about building these powerful models 
            and implementing them in ethical and responsible ways.

            MODERN ALGEBRA TEACHING ASSISTANT

        <p>
            For the past two years, I have served as the teaching assistant for the Modern Algbebra 
            Mathematics course. Modern Algebra is an advanced level proofwriting class and is a 
            requirement for all math majors. This job requires that I hold weekly TA hours during
            which I am available to students to answer questions on homeworks or exam prep. It also involves 
            grading and leaving feedback on biweekly computational homework assignments. 
            This position has been more valuable than I knew when I first accepted the job. 
            After having some industry experience in technical roles, I have learned that being able 
            to convey complex technical ideas to a nontechnical peer is a hugely valuable skill. 
            Whether it be communicating an idea to a manager, marketing team or customer, being able 
            to comprehensibly describe complex ideas in simple terms is essential to success in a technical 
            role. In this role, I had to learn how to assess and cater to each student's needs and current 
            understanding, and convey concepts in a way that would be most beneficial to them specifically.
